 Casting/Forming/Cladding Inspection
Goal: Check for shape accuracy, air bubbles, uniformity.

AI Automation Solution:

High-Speed Camera + Vision AI: Capture every molded/form part and run AI-based defect detection.

3D Scanners: For form validation (e.g., candle molds with uniformity).

Tools: NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, OpenCV + YOLOv8 for real-time object defect detection.
