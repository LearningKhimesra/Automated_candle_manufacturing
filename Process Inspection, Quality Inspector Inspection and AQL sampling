 Casting/Forming/Cladding Inspection
Goal: Check for shape accuracy, air bubbles, uniformity.

AI Automation Solution:

High-Speed Camera + Vision AI: Capture every molded/form part and run AI-based defect detection.

3D Scanners: For form validation (e.g., candle molds with uniformity).

Tools: NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, OpenCV + YOLOv8 for real-time object defect detection.

Process Inspection (Post-Casting/Forming)
Goal: Verify quality of formed product.

AI Automation Solution:

Thermal Imaging + AI: Detect imperfections, cracks, or internal faults.

AI-based Quality Score: Aggregate multi-sensor data to give each unit a quality score.
