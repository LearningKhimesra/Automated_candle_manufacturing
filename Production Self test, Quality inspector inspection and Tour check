 Production Self-Test & Quality Inspector Checks
Goal: Monitor quality during mixing/melting.

AI Automation Solution:

Sensor Integration + Anomaly Detection: Add temperature, viscosity, and time sensors with ML models to detect outliers.

Edge AI: Use real-time models on Raspberry Pi/NVIDIA Jetson to evaluate in production lines.

Tools: AWS Lookout for Equipment, Azure Edge AI, TensorFlow Lite.
