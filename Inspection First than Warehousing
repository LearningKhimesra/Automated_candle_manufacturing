Raw Material Inspection
Goal: Check for impurities, correct types, and quality.

AI Automation Solution:

Computer Vision + Spectroscopy: Use cameras and hyperspectral imaging to verify color, texture, and chemical properties.

ML Model: Train a model on known “good” vs. “bad” raw materials.

Toolkits: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or AWS Lookout for Vision.
